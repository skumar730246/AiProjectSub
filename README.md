This is my individual project to build and implementing an AI model on detecting the helmets from the frames or an image. This project uses pre-defined training dataset from COCO dataset.
By building this model we can process the image , extract or detect helmet from the image and tell wheather person is wearing it or not
COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.

Apart from the training dataset i've successfully implemented the accuracy of 95% from this taining values.
There is an problem with existing model because it is partially developed system so we can train as amny possible values as we want

Sir Report Upload Kar Rhaa Hu !
